We are pleased to release version 2.000 of the Kedebideri font. The font package is available for download from the [Download page](https://software.sil.org/kedebideri/download/).

_The Beria Erfe script has received [provisional codepoint assignments](https://www.unicode.org/alloc/Pipeline.html) by the Unicode Technical Committee. The script has not yet been formally accepted and approved for a future version of the Unicode Standard. The Kedebideri font is using the provisional codepoints, but those codepoints can always change. Should those codepoints change, this font would be re-released with the new encoding. Documents would then need converting to use the new codepoints._

One weight for this typeface family is included:

- Kedebideri Regular

### Known issues

Because this font uses provisional Unicode codepoints, there is a chance that the codepoints in this font will change. If you use this font, and codepoints are changed, your data will need converting to the new codepoints.

Both desktop and web fonts are provided in a single, all-platforms package on the [Download Page](https://software.sil.org/kedebideri/download).

A Keyman keyboard for the Beria Erfe script is also available:
