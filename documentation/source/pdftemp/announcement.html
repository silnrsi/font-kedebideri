    <p>We are pleased to release version 2.000 of the Kedebideri font.
    The font package is available for download from the <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/kedebideri/download/">Download
    page</a>.</p>
    <p><em>The Beria Erfe script has received <a
    href="https://www.unicode.org/alloc/Pipeline.html">provisional
    codepoint assignments</a> by the Unicode Technical Committee. The
    script has not yet been formally accepted and approved for a future
    version of the Unicode Standard. The Kedebideri font is using the
    provisional codepoints, but those codepoints can always change.
    Should those codepoints change, this font would be re-released with
    the new encoding. Documents would then need converting to use the
    new codepoints.</em></p>
    <p>One weight for this typeface family is included:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Kedebideri Regular</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="known-issues">Known issues</h3>
    <p>Because this font uses provisional Unicode codepoints, there is a
    chance that the codepoints in this font will change. If you use this
    font, and codepoints are changed, your data will need converting to
    the new codepoints.</p>
    <p>Both desktop and web fonts are provided in a single,
    all-platforms package on the <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/kedebideri/download">Download
    Page</a>.</p>
    <p>A Keyman keyboard for the Beria Erfe script is also
    available:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://keyman.com/keyboards/beria_erfe_phonetic">Beria
    Erfe Phonetic</a></li>
    </ul>
