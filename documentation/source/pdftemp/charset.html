    <p><em>The Beria Erfe script has received <a
    href="https://www.unicode.org/alloc/Pipeline.html">provisional
    codepoint assignments</a> by the Unicode Technical Committee. The
    script has not yet been formally accepted and approved for a future
    version of the Unicode Standard. The Kedebideri font is using the
    provisional codepoints, but those codepoints can always change.
    Should those codepoints change, this font would be re-released with
    the new encoding. Documents would then need converting to use the
    new codepoints.</em></p>
    <p>The Kedebideri font supports the characters in the Beria Erfe
    block.</p>
    <h2 id="supported-characters">Supported characters</h2>
    <p>The following character ranges are supported by this font:</p>
    <table>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th>Unicode block</th>
    <th>Kedebideri support</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td>Beria Erfe (16EA0..16EDF)</td>
    <td>✓</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td>Codepage 1252 (Western)¹</td>
    <td>✓</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>A selection of characters from the General Punctuation block,
    such as various-sized spaces, are also supported; a utility such as
    <a href="https://scripts.sil.org/ViewGlyph_home">SIL ViewGlyph</a>
    can be used to examine the exact repertoire of this font.</p>
    <p>¹Inclusion of basic Latin repertoire is provided as a
    convenience, e.g., for use in menus or for displaying markup in text
    files; these fonts are not intended for extensive Latin script
    use.</p>
