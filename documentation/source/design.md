The Kedebideri family of fonts supports the Beria Erfe script which is used by the Zaghawa Beria language of Sudan and Chad.

This font was initially designed by a volunteer who chooses to remain anonymous, in cooperation with SIL International and the Mission Protestante Franco-Suisse au Tchad.

One font from this typeface family is included in the *Kedebideri* release:

* Kedebideri Regular
