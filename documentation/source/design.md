title: Kedebideri - Design
fontversion: 2.000
---

The Kedebideri font supports the Beria Erfe script which is used for the Zaghawa Beria language of Sudan and Chad.

This font was initially designed by a volunteer who chooses to remain anonymous, in cooperation with SIL Global and the Mission Protestante Franco-Suisse au Tchad.

The Latin glyphs were imported from Source Sans Pro at 103% and a weight of CSS 360.

One font from this typeface family is included in the *Kedebideri* release:

* Kedebideri Regular
