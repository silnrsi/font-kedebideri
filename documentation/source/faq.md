Here are a few of the most frequently asked questions specifically regarding Kedebideri:

#### *Where does the name Kedebideri come from?*

Kedebideri means "Let's write!" in the Zaghawa Beria language of Sudan and Chad.

#### *Since the Beria Erfe script is not officially in the Unicode Standard, what are the problems I might encounter?*

This font is using codepoints that are not officially in the Unicode Standard. The Beria Erfe script has been accepted for encoding into the standard, but those codepoints can always change. Once the script is in a published version of Unicode the encoding assignments may change. If you use this font, and codepoints are changed, this font will be updated and your data will need converting to the new codepoints.
